# Class: xrootd
#
#  This is a base installation of xrootd
#
#  Xrootd is a high performance network storage system widely used in high energy
#  physics experiments such as ATLAS and ALICE. The underlying Xroot data transfer
#  protocol provides highly efficient access to ROOT based data files. This class provides
#  the basis for creating a simple Xrootd storage system consisting of one
#  redirector node and one or more data server nodes.
#
# Parameters:
#    $user: XrootD user
#    $group: XrootD group
#    $homedir: XrootD user home directory
#    $rundir: XrootD run directory
#    $logdir: XrootD log directory
#
# Actions:
#   - installs xrootd-server
#   - setup xrootd user and group
#   - setup xrootd log dir
#
# Requires:
#   - This has been tested on CentOS6
